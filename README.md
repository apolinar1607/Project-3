# Project-3 Job Trace

  ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache-blue)

  ## Description 
  
  This application is a Job Trace application that can be used to store details of personnel activities in a given organization. In addition, this app could track team member activities on a system where entries are saved and concealed in a database.

  The Front-End is done using ReactJS utilizing basic concepts and hooks. The Back-End was written using ExpressJS, MongoDB, and Mongoose (Object Data Modelling for MongoDB and NodeJS). I created a Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handle routes with Express. Programming of the application was done with separate folder for front-end and back-end application.
